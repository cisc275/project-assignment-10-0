Have you ever played any fun educational game? Many people feel that they haven't so, we tried to fixed that issue in our estuary-based game. In our game, you have the opportunity not only learn the migration birds and non-migration birds, but also view their world through their eyes. You will learn how to build the nest, learn migration patterns, gather food and defend your babies from predators from stealing your babies. We have strategically placed quizzes throughout the game in order to allow you to learn while having fun. In case you lose the game, we will ask you some interesting questions to bring you back. And we promise you that you will not only have fun (revel in the game) but also learn some useful facts along the way.

Our game will have 2 separate mini games, one for the migratory osprey and one for the non-migratory Northern Harrier.  The Osprey game is a side swiper and the northern harrier game is a item collector game.
